    Describe how to run 'args' inside a linux-user-chroot container.

    The subprocess will only be permitted to write to the paths we
    specifically allow it to write to, listed in 'writeable paths'. All
    other locations in the file system will be read-only.

    The 'binds' parameter allows mounting of arbitrary file-systems,
    such as tmpfs, before running commands, by setting it to a list of
    (mount_point, mount_type, source) triples.

    The 'root' parameter allows running the command in a chroot, allowing
    the host file system to be hidden completely except for the paths
    below 'root'.

    The 'mount_proc' flag enables mounting of /proc inside 'root'.
    Locations from the file system can be bind-mounted inside 'root' by
    setting 'binds' to a list of (src, dest) pairs. The 'dest'
    directory must be inside 'root'.

    The subprocess will be run in a separate mount namespace. It can
    optionally be run in a separate network namespace too by setting
    'unshare_net'.

    Given a traversal of a tree and a set of paths separated by os.sep,
    return the files and directories that are not part of the set of
    paths, culling directories that do not need to be recursed into,
    if the traversal supports this.

    `tree_walker` is expected to follow similar behaviour to `os.walk()`.

    This function will remove directores from the ones listed, to avoid
    traversing into these subdirectories, if it doesn't need to.

    As such, if a directory is returned, it is implied that its contents
    are also not in the set of paths.

    If the tree walker does not support culling the traversal this way,
    such as `os.walk(root, topdown=False)`, then the contents will also
    be returned.

    The purpose for this is to list the directories that can be made
    read-only, such that it would leave everything in paths writable.

    Each path in `paths` is expected to begin with the same path as
    yielded by the tree walker.
